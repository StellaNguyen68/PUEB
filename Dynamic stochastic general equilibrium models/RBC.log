There are 2 eigenvalue(s) larger than 1 in modulus 
for 2 forward-looking variable(s)

The rank condition is verified.

MODEL_DIAGNOSTICS:  No obvious problems with this mod-file were detected.
                                          Information about RBC (dynamic model)

The following variables appear with a lag and are therefore states:
K(-1)
A(-1)

The following variables appear with a lead and are therefore forward-looking variables:
C(1)
R(1)

The following variables do not appear with a lead or lag and are therefore purely static variables:
Y
I
W
L
